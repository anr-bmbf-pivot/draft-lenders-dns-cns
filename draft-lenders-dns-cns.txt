       Guidance on DNS message composition in constraint networks
                      draft-lenders-dns-cns-latest

Abstract

   This document provides guidance on the composition of DNS messages in
   low power and lossy networks, where payload sizes can be heavily
   restricted by the link layer.

1.  Introduction

   Constrained networks [RFC7228], such as IEEE 802.15.4 or LoRaWAN,
   often come with restrictions to the protocol data unit (PDU) in the
   link layer.  While adoption layers such as 6LoWPAN [RFC4944] and SCHC
   [RFC8724] provide mitigation in the form of compression and
   fragmentation to allow for IPv6 traffic, restricting the application
   data to a minimum size greatly increases reliability.  This document
   provides guidance on the composition of DNS messages to prevent
   fragmentation in constrained networks.

2.  Terminology

   TBD

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Constrained Node Considerations

   Nodes within an constrained networks are only to assumed stub
   resolvers.  That means they only query information from an upstream
   DNS server but MUST NOT distribute DNS information, possibly received
   from an upstream DNS server, themselves.

4.  DNS Server Consideration

   A DNS server that is aware that the querying node is a node within a
   constrained network SHOULD resolve a CNAME until the originally
   requested resource record type is reached.  This reduces the number
   of message exchanges within a constrained network.

   The DNS server SHOULD send compact answers, i.e., additional or
   authority sections in the DNS response should only be sent if needed
   or if it is anticipated that they help the DoC client to reduce
   additional queries.

5.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
